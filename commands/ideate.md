# Ideate - Getting Unstuck

Use this when you feel stuck, blocked, or uncertain about next steps.

## Step 1: Assess Current State

1. What task were you trying to accomplish?
2. What's blocking progress?
3. Are there any errors or unexpected behaviors?

## Step 2: Check Available Context

1. Review `list_tasks` for tracked tasks that might help
2. Check CLAUDE.md for guidance you might have missed
3. Look at git status to see what work is in flight

## Step 3: Brainstorm Approaches

Consider these strategies for getting unstuck:

- **Break it down**: Is the task too large? Split into smaller steps
- **Try a different angle**: Is there another way to approach this?
- **Reduce scope**: Can you accomplish a simpler version first?
- **Skip and return**: Can you work on something else and come back?
- **Ask for help**: Would user input help clarify the path forward?

## Step 4: Choose and Execute

1. Pick the most promising approach
2. If still stuck, use `create_task` to log the blocker
3. Move on to the next available task

## Key Principle

When blocked on one task:
1. Log the blocker
2. Move to the next ready task
3. Return to blocked tasks when conditions change
