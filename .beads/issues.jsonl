{"id":"claude-reliability-7b0","title":"Investigate missing reflection prompt before stop","description":"When Claude stopped working on a task without completing the user's request (wrote tests but didn't run them to generate real transcripts, tried to manually write transcript.jsonl files instead), the stop hook allowed the exit after the uncommitted changes were committed. There should have been a reflection prompt asking 'Have you actually done what the user asked?' but it did not appear. Need to investigate why this prompt didn't fire or if it needs to be more prominent.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"david@drmaciver.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T09:54:20.506855639Z","created_by":"David R.
