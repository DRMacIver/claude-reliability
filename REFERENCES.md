## Skills

### Get to 100% Coverage

The "Galahad Principle" section in the coverage skill is based on:

- **The Galahad Principle** by Jonathan Lange
  - URL: https://jml.io/galahad-principle/
  - The article argues that certain endeavors require completeness to become worthwhile - in contrast to the Pareto principle's 80/20 rule. For test coverage, 100% provides disproportionate value through simplicity (a binary state) and trust (absence of coverage becomes evidence of a problem).
