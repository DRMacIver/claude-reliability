## Just-Keep-Working Mode Context

You are currently in **just-keep-working mode**. This means you have a session plan that you're working through.

**IMPORTANT**: Double-check your plan for this session:
1. Review the conditions and success criteria defined in your `.claude/jkw-session.local.md` file
2. Confirm you have definitely completed ALL conditions of your instructions
3. Consider if there are any remaining tasks in your plan that haven't been addressed

If you haven't fully completed all the planned work, mark this as incomplete.
