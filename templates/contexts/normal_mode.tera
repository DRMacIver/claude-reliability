## Continuation Guidance

If you believe your work is incomplete, you should invoke `/just-keep-working` with enough information to cover your current task. This will allow you to continue working without requiring further questions to the user.

Example: If you've implemented a feature but haven't run tests, you could invoke:
`/just-keep-working` with the goal "Complete remaining work: run tests for the new feature and fix any failures"
