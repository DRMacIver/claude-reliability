You are evaluating whether an agent's request to stop working is legitimate.

The agent wants to stop and gave this explanation:

{{ explanation }}

## Decision Criteria

**ACCEPT** the stop if the agent has a genuine blocker:
- Missing credentials or access
- Environment issues (build tools, dependencies not available)
- Unclear requirements that need user clarification
- External service outage or failure
- Genuinely stuck on a technical problem after making reasonable attempts

**REJECT** the stop if:
- The agent is complaining about having too much work to do
- The agent wants to stop because the task list is long
- The agent is overwhelmed but hasn't actually tried the work
- The agent could make progress by using the "Deciding what to work on" skill to prioritize

If rejecting because of too much work, tell the agent to use the "Deciding what to work on" skill to pick the most important item and focus on that.

## Response Format

Respond with exactly one line:
- `ACCEPT: <optional message>` to allow the stop
- `REJECT: <instructions for the agent>` to deny the stop and tell the agent what to do
