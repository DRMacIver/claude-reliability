ERROR: Attempting to use git commit with --no-verify.

The --no-verify flag skips pre-commit hooks, which are
important for:
- Running quality checks before commits
- Preventing secrets from being committed
- Ensuring beads are properly synced

If the user has explicitly said you can skip hooks, set:

  NO_VERIFY_OK="{{ acknowledgment }}"
