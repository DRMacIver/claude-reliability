# Task Required

You are attempting to make code changes (Write/Edit) without an active task.

**All code changes must be tracked in the task system.**

Before making changes, you must:

1. **Find or create a task** that describes what you're working on
2. **Call `work_on`** with the task ID to mark it as in-progress

Example:
```
# If a task already exists
work_on(task_id="my-task-1234")

# If you need to create a new task first
create_task(title="Fix bug in login flow", description="...")
work_on(task_id="<returned-task-id>")
```

This ensures all work is properly tracked and helps maintain context across sessions.
