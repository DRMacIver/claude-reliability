# Quick Setup: Start a Work Item

Before making code changes, please set up a work item to track what you're working on. This helps maintain context and keeps work organized.

**Quick start:**

```
# If a relevant work item already exists:
work_on(work_item_id="<item-id>")

# Or create a new one:
create_work_item(title="Brief description of what you're doing", description="...")
work_on(work_item_id="<returned-item-id>")
```

This only takes a moment and helps you (and future sessions) stay oriented.
