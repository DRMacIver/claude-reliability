# Problem Mode

You've indicated you need help with something. Tools are paused so you can explain the situation to the user.

## Please share:

1. **What you were trying to do**
2. **What's blocking you** - What went wrong or what decision do you need?
3. **What would help** - What do you need from the user to move forward?

Once you've explained, stop and wait for the user's response. They'll be able to help once they understand the situation.
