# Problem Mode Activated

You've indicated you've hit a problem. **All tool use is now blocked.**

## What to do now:

1. **Explain the problem clearly** - What exactly went wrong?
2. **Describe what you tried** - What approaches did you attempt?
3. **State what you need** - What specific help or decision do you need from the user?

Once you've explained the problem, you will be able to stop and wait for the user's response.

**Do not attempt to use any tools until you've stopped and the user has responded.**
