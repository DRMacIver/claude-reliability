# Follow-Up Work Items

Before stopping, consider whether there are follow-up work items to track:

- **TODOs discovered**: Any tasks you noticed but didn't address
- **Out-of-scope changes**: Improvements related to the work but beyond the current scope
- **Technical debt**: Code quality issues worth tracking for later

## What to do

If there are follow-up items, create them now:
```
claude-reliability work create -t "Title" -d "Description"
```

If there are no follow-up items, stop again to continue.
