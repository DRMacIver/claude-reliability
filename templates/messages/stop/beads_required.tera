# Beads Interaction Required

You have uncommitted changes but haven't interacted with beads.

In Claude Code sessions, work should be tracked in beads:
  - Create an issue: `bd create "Issue title"`
  - Claim work: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
  - Complete work: `bd close <id>`

If this work genuinely doesn't need tracking, try stopping again.
