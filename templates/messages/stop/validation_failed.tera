# Quality Check Issues

The quality check (`{{ check_cmd }}`) found some issues.

{% if stdout %}
**Output:**
{{ stdout }}
{% endif %}
{% if stderr %}
**Errors:**
{{ stderr }}
{% endif %}

Please fix these issues. Leaving the codebase in good shape - whether you introduced the issues or not - is part of doing excellent work.

A clean quality check means your work is truly complete.
