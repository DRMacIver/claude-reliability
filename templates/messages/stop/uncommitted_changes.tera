# Uncommitted Changes

You have {{ changes_description }} that should be committed before stopping.

{% if quality_failed %}
## Quality Issues

Quality checks didn't pass. Please address these:

{% if quality_output %}
{{ quality_output }}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% if secret_violations %}
## Security Alert: Secrets Detected

Found potential secrets in staged changes:

{% for v in secret_violations %}
{{ v }}
{% endfor %}

Remove these before committing. Use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.
{% endif %}
{% if untracked_files %}
## Untracked Files

These files aren't tracked by git:

{% for f in untracked_files %}
  {{ f }}
{% endfor %}

Add them with `git add` or add to .gitignore if they shouldn't be committed.
{% endif %}

2. {% if quality_check_enabled %}Fix any quality issues{% else %}Make sure the code is in good shape{% endif %}
3. Commit: `git add <files> && git commit -m "..."`
{% if require_push %}4. Push: `git push`{% endif %}
