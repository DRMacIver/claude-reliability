Keep working on your current task. Make progress, commit changes when meaningful, and run quality checks when you've completed something.

{% if iterations_since_change > 2 %}
Note: It's been a few iterations without git changes. If you're working on something complex, that's fine - just make sure you're making progress. If you're stuck, consider asking for help.
