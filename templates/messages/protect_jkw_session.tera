# JKW Session File - Deletion Blocked

Do not manually delete JKW session files (`.claude/jkw-session.local.md` or `.claude/jkw-state.local.yaml`).

The stop hook automatically cleans up these files when just-keep-working mode ends normally. If you need to cancel JKW mode, use the `/cancel-just-keep-working` command instead.
