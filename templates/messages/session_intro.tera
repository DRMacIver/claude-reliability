# Claude Reliability Mode

This session has reliability features enabled:

- **Stop hook**: Validates work completion before allowing exit
- **Code review**: Automated review on git commits
- **Quality gates**: Must pass before stopping (if configured)
- **Issue tracking**: Use `bd` commands to track and manage work

Use `/just-keep-working` to enter autonomous work mode.

Say an exit phrase when done:
- "I have completed all work that I can and require human input to proceed."
- "I have run into a problem I can't solve without user input."
