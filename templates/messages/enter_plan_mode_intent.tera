# Before Planning: Understand What the User Actually Wants

Before creating your plan, systematically verify you understand the user's actual intent — not just a literal reading of their words. The most expensive failure mode is building something that technically satisfies a request but is obviously useless.

## 1. Identify the Load-Bearing Feature

State in one sentence: "The central point of this request is ___."

If your plan doesn't deliver this central feature, nothing else matters. A notification system that doesn't deliver notifications, a cache that doesn't invalidate, a test that doesn't assert — these are all examples of missing the load-bearing feature.

## 2. Surface the Obvious Implications

Ask: "If I described my plan to the person who made this request, would they say 'but obviously I also need X'?"

Common implicit expectations:
- Things that are added must be connected to the system (not standalone dead code)
- Things that are built must actually function (not stubs or placeholders)
- Things must work in context (not just in isolation)
- Changes should be made where they belong (right project, right module, right directory)
- If adding a hook, it must be registered and triggered. If adding a skill, it must be discoverable.

## 3. Sanity Check Your Interpretation

- Re-read the request word by word. Does your plan address each element?
- Is your plan solving the problem that was asked about, or a different (usually easier) one?
- Is the scope right? A reasonable request leading to a trivial change, or an enormous rewrite, suggests misunderstanding.
- Would the user recognize your plan as fulfilling their request — not just technically, but actually?

**Red flags:** Your plan ignores a key phrase in the request. You're solving a suspiciously easier problem. You're adding things but not connecting them. You're working in the wrong place.

## 4. After Implementation: Verify

- Walk through the original request again and check every element is addressed
- Test the complete flow end-to-end from the user's perspective
- Apply the "Would I accept this?" test: if you made this request, would you be satisfied?
