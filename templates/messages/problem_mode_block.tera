# Problem Mode - User Input Needed

You've indicated you've hit a problem that needs user input. Tools are paused until you've explained the situation.

You attempted to use: `{{ tool_name }}`

## What to do now:

1. **Explain clearly to the user:**
   - What you were trying to do
   - What went wrong or what's blocking you
   - What specific help or decision you need from them

2. **Then stop** - Once you've explained, your next stop will go through and the user can respond.

This pause is just to make sure you communicate the problem clearly before trying more things. It's not a punishment - it's a chance to get the help you need.
