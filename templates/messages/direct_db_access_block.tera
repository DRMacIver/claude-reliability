{# Message shown when direct sqlite3 access to the working-memory database is blocked. #}
ERROR: Direct database access to the working-memory database is not allowed.

Use the CLI binary instead:

    .claude-reliability/bin/claude-reliability work list
    .claude-reliability/bin/claude-reliability work update <id> --status complete
    .claude-reliability/bin/claude-reliability work next

Direct sqlite3 access bypasses validation, audit logging, and other safeguards.
Run `.claude-reliability/bin/claude-reliability --help` for available commands.
